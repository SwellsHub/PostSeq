<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

PostSeq is a webapp hosted at 134.68.250.10:3838/shinyApp which increases the effciency and approachability of RNAseq analysis.
PostSeq allows you to complete differential expression, PCA, pathway analysis and more through a streamlined graphical interface that requires no coding.

Additionally, PostSeq allows you to upload your sequencing data to a MySQL database where it can be retrieved or further analyzed at any time.

### Built With
PostSeq is built in Shiny, a popular package used to build webapps with R code. PostSeq is also linked to a MySQL database to host and retrieve sequencing data
* [RShiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)




<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

PostSeq can be accessed with no installation at 134.68.250.10:3838/shinyApp . This is the recommended way to use the app and allows you to access all functionalities of the program. 

If you want to host a local instance of PostSeq, the setup process consists of launching a shiny server on your own linux server and populating it with the files in this Repo. Detailed instructions on how to install and maintain a shiny server can be found at [https://docs.rstudio.com/shiny-server/](https://docs.rstudio.com/shiny-server/)


### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https:://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```
3. Install NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
```JS
const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
```
